# Unit 4 - Ethics and Social Responsibility

Some questions to review as a consumer:

- **Why does a business exist?** Are they fulfilling the needs/wants of customers, and are they supporting the communities around them?
- **How does the business operate?** What’s their impact on the community and the environment? Where do they collect their resources?
- **Who do they associate with?** How are they connected with other businesses or influential figures, like politicians or celebrities?
- **What do they believe in?** Where do they stand on social/political issues?

When thinking about ==ethics==, at least on a global scale for businesses, you have to consider things like how employee safety and labour standards may differ. There are different values and practices in place in each country, how they protect the environment, etc. Companies should be aware of these differences, as well as laws and regulations to drive their business decisions on what is ethically right, and if they’re upholding their core values.

==Social responsibility== revolves around how they’re giving back to communities around them, and doing their part to take care of the environment. 

## Ethics

This is all about making decisions that impact the image and the reputation of your company. Consider Facebook, for example. Their planning and decision-making with respect to user information and privacy has been scrutinized, and this reduces consumer trust. Trust is hard earned but easily lost. Even if they haven’t broken any laws, this doesn’t mean they’ve done the “right thing”.

### Legality VS Ethics

==Laws== are rules and regulations that support order within society. Those that violate these laws are putting themselves, or others, at risk, and are appropriately penalized. They don’t stop bad behaviour though. This is when ethics comes in. 

==Ethics== are the guiding principles that help us with decision-making. What’s “good” vs “bad”, “right” vs “wrong” in a given context. It ultimately comes down to the question: *How do we treat each other?*

> Some companies can stay within the law, but their practice may not be ethical.
>
> - Raising the prices of a product (ie a drug that only you’re producing)
> - Tax loopholes
> - Child Labour (depends on the country)

> Similarly, some may break the law in an ethical act. For example:
>
> - Speeding through a red light in an emergency
> - Protests
> - Medical assistance to the dying (some jurisdictions prohibit this)

### Ethics in Business

Having clear, shared values within an organization helps employees make choices that are economically ethical, sound, and responsible. Good ethics correlates with good business. As your social reputation rises, you’ll be able to reap the benefits:

- keep/attract customers/employees
- maintain a strong reputation in a competitive market
- avoid government intervention
- avoid legal action

Businesses can support ethics in many ways, mainly displayed by their company culture. A code of conduct, training, and adequate ethics resources are all good things to have. Most importantly though, management should be setting the example.

### Whisleblower Lesgislation

==Whistleblowers== are those who step up to report illegal or unethical behaviour. There’s some legislation in Canada to support whistleblowers from harm or retaliation in the workplace, but this isn’t in all countries. Having whistleblower policies in place can hold all employees accountable, and provide a clearly defined process for them to express feedback and concerns. 

### Ethical Dilemmas

An ==ethical dilemma== is defined as a problem where a difficult choice has to be made with potentially no desirable alternatives. A good example of this is the pharmaceutical industry. They struggle to balance the following:

- **Releasing a drug ASAP** to help people, but also to get profits sooner. Should more testing happen to ensure it’s safety?
- **Testing practices**: is toxicology testing on animals ethical? What if we have willing volunteers? How do we judge if it’s safe enough for them?
- **Pricing their drugs**: new drugs and treatments benefit society, but companies also need to turn in profits. At what point is it fair to raise costs on consumers VS making it more accessible to those that need it?

This is why it’s important to have a strong set of shared values and a code of conduct to guide ethical decision making. Here are some questions you can ask yourself given an ethical dilemma:

1. Does it violate any laws/policies?
2. Are the alternatives fair for all stakeholders?
3. How will you *feel* about the decision?

## Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

This is how a company steps up to take care of those around them in society. Critics argue that the main responsibility for a company is to maximize profits and shareholder value, so when a company dedicates funds to being socially responsible, they’re in fact stealing from investors! :open_mouth: Supporters argue that by investing in social responsibility, they actually generate more money for investors in the long run through brand strengthening and customer attraction/retention.

### Benefits of Investing in Social Responsibility

Positive image and strong internal culture goes a long way. Socially responsible companies with high sustainability practices consistently outperform others, and shared value approaches have been related to how companies connect success with social progress, setting themselves up for growth and success. 

Some more benefits to investing in CSR:

- Financially
  - increased market value and shareholder value long term
  - avoid market losses from crises
- Marketing and sales
  - increases revenue and price premium
- Human resources
  - reduced turnover rate and increased employee productivity and engagement

==Corporate philanthropy== is donating money or time and skills to various causes. These can be one-time initiatives, or ongoing support for certain causes. Like how McDonalds has their Ronald McDonald House, which helps out families with housing when they’re out of town for medical treatment for their children. Also, hiring equally and having a diverse workforce. Or how tentree plants 10 trees for every article purchased. 

Companies might also incorporate “fair trade” into their operations. This means that producers in developing countries are paid a fair price for the goods they make. 

### Sustainable Development

This looks at business operations and checks if they support the needs for current and future generations without negative consequences. Wind/solar power over oil and gas?

Businesses can support this by taking care of their employees and allocating budgets towards sustainability. Constant audits and reports of progress help us see what some potential next steps are to continue to have positive social, environmental and economic impact. 

## Responsibility to Stakeholders

### Internal Stakeholders

Employees! Companies are responsible for creating meaningful jobs with growth potential. Fair compensation, safe environments, all this contributes. Jobs are viewed as social mechanisms to keep people productive in society, otherwise social challenges begin to rise.

### External Stakeholders

- **Customers**: Understanding and satisfying their needs and wants by providing safe and quality goods/services
- **Investors**: Financial benefit arises from ethical and responsible behaviour, which drives shareholder weath, adds profitability. Socially conscious investors are becoming more and more popular.
- **Environment**: “Green” efforts and policies, attempts to reduce their carbon footprint. Renewables reduce waste.

## Future Opportunities and Challenges

==Social audits== are evaluations on how a company makes process towards their social responsibility priorities. No requirements to have this, but some companies feel it’s their duty to do so.

Using the ==Triple Bottom Line== (TBL) is a popular method to report this. “Bottom line” refers to net income, but the triple bottom line goes beyond and considers the impact on social and environmental paramters as well. It aims to address:

- People (Social Issues)
- Planet (Environmental Issues)
- Profit (Economic Issues)

The problem is that there are no widely agreed upon measurement standards, so then they end up being quite subjective across different companies. 

Beyond TBL, companies might get certifications from external bodies to show their commitment to being socially responsible.
