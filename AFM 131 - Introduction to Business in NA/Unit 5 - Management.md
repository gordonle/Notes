# Unit 5 - Management

Organizations find success when they are managed well, and can adapt to the fast-changing business environment around them. Proper planning and management of resources including money, assets, information and people has been emphasized more than ever. Leadership too. To manage these resources effectively, there are core functions we must examine:

1. Plan
2. Organize
3. Lead
4. Control

## Plan

There are a few questions that we must consider no matter the stage of your business:

1. **Where are we now?**

   This examines the current state. Internally, where are the strengths, weaknesses and growth opportunities? Externally, what contexts can impact your success? Are there trends and challenges to keep an eye on?

2. **Where do we want to be?**

   What’s the future for this organization, and do our desires and goals match?

3. **How can we get there from here?**

   After answering the above two questions, we must address and close the gaps to meet our goals. If we need to hire more, then we hire more. Changing processes and moving forwards is the goal.

Planning often starts by defining a *vision*, *mission statement* and *values*. These provide direction for where an organization will head and ensures everyone is on the same page.

A ==vision== describes why we exist and where we plan on heading. It aims to inspire our employees to make decisions and act in accordance to this roadmap towards a common goal. Every decision is made considering the vision. 

To help achieve this vision, the ==mission statement== is developed, which describes the current purpose. Where a vision is a **long-term** goal, a mission statement is the **current** purpose. It typically addresses *Why the business exists* and *what makes us unique*. 

>“The mission of The Walt Disney Company is to be one of the world’s leading producers and providers of entertainment and information. Using our portfolio of brands to differentiate our content, services and consumer products, we seek to develop the most creative, innovative and profitable entertainment experiences and related products in the world.”
>
>The first sentence is the vision, and their mission statement follows.

Core ==values== are fundamental beliefs that align us and guide decision making. They guide day-to-day decision making, and define what is acceptable behaviour. They help define how employees represent themselves and the brand, as well as how to engage with others.

To ensure values are embraced and that employees live and breathe these values, leadership must ask these questions:

1. Are these values communicated to all employees, and especially to new hires?
2. Are they prominent?
3. Are they modeled by leaders within the organization?

### SMART Goals

- <u>Specific</u> - clear and unambiguous? 
- <u>Measurable</u> - can we measure and quantify our progress?
- <u>Attainable</u> - achievable given the resources involved?
- <u>Relevant</u> - aligns with vision and mission statement?
- <u>Timely</u> - specified time frame?

Setting SMART goals is key to create realistic targets to reach. For example, 

> To grow sales by 5% in the next quarter by reaching our target market with advertising through their preferred social media channels.

### Contingency Plans

What happens when things don’t go as intended? We need backup plans. ==Contingency plans== comes in here. They recognize how the future is uncertain, and highlight the importance of having backup plans to stay flexible and to mitigate risks. 

Here are some examples:

> If sales are not growing as anticipated towards a goal (such as the SMART goal specified above), a contingency plan could involve increased spending on advertising or changing prices to stimulate sales.

> Handling a crisis — What happens when a business faces a crisis (such as a natural disaster)? A plan could be in place to help support their employees to get back on their feet and then to get business operations up and running again. Consider how companies can rely on backups of their information or access this information remotely from other locations with more data being stored in the cloud.

## Organize

It is the management function that puts plans into action. It starts by designing the structure of an organization. We need to do the following:

- **Allocate resources** - How do we align people, finances, materials, equipment, or information to work towards the goal?
- **Assign tasks** - How to assign what to do and who should do it?
- **Design processes and procedures** - How will information flow within the org, and how do we manage relationships, or how should we make products/provide services?

### The Star Model

This model identifies five considerations - strategy, structure, processes, rewards, and people. 

### Strategy

This is at the top of the star. Essentially a plan on how to achieve organizational goals through their vision, mission and values. Elements from the Star Model that help reinforce a company’s strategy include:

- **Structure** - how power and authority is structured
- **Processes** - work and information flow
- **Rewards** - how to align employee goals with those of the organization, and to encourage supported behaviours within the org
- **People** - what skills and knowledge should our employees possess? How do we attract and retain top talent?

### Structure

An ==organizational chart== provides a great glimpse of how people are organized. The “C-Suite” of roles drive the company towards its vision, while supporting a strong company culture. Organizations also have middle management levels and supervisory management roles. A trend today is to reduce these levels, and collapse their hierarchies. Since employees are now more talented, they need less supervision and they will be empowered to work more. This also makes for more flexible to changing customer needs.

### Processes

The usage of teams and collaboration is very popular. How are the functions of work defined and how do they benefit both the employees and the consumers.

### Rewards

Consideration should be placed on how to celebrate the achievements of employees through recognition or rewards. 

### People

What skills should our employees have?

- **Human skills** - interpersonal skills, communication
- **Technical skills** - knowledge and ability to perform tasks
- **Conceptual skills** - analytical and critical thinking skills

Human skills are valuable overall, but as you ascend the management ladder, the emphasis shifts from technical skills to conceptual skills.

## Lead

Management has been defined as “the art of getting things done through people”, and “leadership is not defined by th exercise of power, but by the capacity to increase the sense of power among those led.. the most essential work of the leader is to create more leaders”. There are certain traits that successful leaders exhibit, such as:

- drive
- cognitive ability
- self-confidence
- honesty and integrity
- leadership motivation (desire and ability to inspire others)

### Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

- **Physiological** - basic needs to survive, like food and water and shelter
- **Safety** - security and stability at home or at work
- **Love/belonging** - social need to belong and be accepted
- **Esteem** - need for respect and to be recognized by others
- **Self-actualization** - reaching our full potential, growth and development

### Leadership Styles

==Autocratic leadership== involves making decisions without consulting others. This is useful when people *must* follow orders, like in emergencies. As well, for first time employees. It may reduce employee morale and job satisfaction though, as it doesn’t empower employees to become self-directed or to take on responsibility.

==Democratic leadership== have people working together to share perspectives and to make informed decisions. It builds consensus and increases job satisfaction. It’s effective when it comes to idea generation or creativity, but can slow down the decision-making process.

==Laissez-faire leadership== sets goals that employees are free to accomplish however they want to. There is a lot of trust placed on employees to perform, and works well when managing distinguished and talented professionals.

## Control

Aims to collect feedback to determine if goals and targets have been met, and to then act accordingly. Consider these 5 steps:

1. Establish clear standards
   - financial measures (key accounting ratios, sales)
   - non-financial measures (customer growth, satisfaction, service time)
2. Monitor and record performance
3. Compare results against standards
4. Communicate results
   - 2-4 looks at how you compare performance against standards, and then communicates the results. Feedback or rewards can be used to reinforce desired behaviour
5. If needed, take corrective actions
   - could mean implementing a contingency plan, or even revisiting standards to assess if they were realistic/attainable or need to be adjusted

### Balanced Scorecard

To fully assess the health and long-term success of an organization, it’s important to take a holistic view of the org. The ==balanced scorecard== does just this, and it looks at four metrics:

- **Financial** - key figures (ie. sales numbers) or their ability to meet key ratios or targets. Assessed by reviewing internal reports or analyzing financial statements
- **Customers** - whether customers are happy and loyal
- **Business processes** - examines what a company excels at operationally
- **Learning & Growth** - considers how you support and develop your employees

This places emphasis on both financial and non-financial measures! It goes beyond a focus on short term results to take a comprehensive view of an org. Metrics around customers, business processes and L&G are more likely to influence long-term performance and success. 

Some challenges could include having too many measures to consider for each metric. If a company can key in on specific measures and act on them, the balanced scorecard can be an effective tool to evaluate progress made towards goals.
