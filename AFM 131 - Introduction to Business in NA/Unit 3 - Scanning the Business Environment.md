## Background and Tools

There are a few tools and processes which will be mentioned as we progress through this chapter. Here’s a few definitions to start off.

An ==environmental scan== is an assessment of the business environment to see what factors could impact growth and the success of an organization in achieving its goals. Political, economic, social, technological, and competitive environments should all be analyzed during this scan for both domestic and global business environments. These can be summarized into ==PEST== (Political Economic Social Technological).

We also need to consider ==Porter’s five forces== during an environmental scan. There are:

1. current competitors
2. potential competitors
3. substitutes
4. bargaining power of suppliers
5. bargaining power of buyers. 

The scan also includes a ==SWOT== analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) for an organization. 

## Political Environments

Governments impact business environments through the laws, taxes and trade relationships they manage. Here in Canada, we have a *mixed economic system*, meaning that some allocation of resources are made by the market, and some are made by the govt to support the overall success of our economy. By looking at the economic system of a place, we can see how the ==factors of production== (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) are managed.

We have three tiers of governments in Canada:

- **<u>Federal</u>**: impacts all of Canada, plays a major role with international trade regulations and the nation’s banking, defense and immigration systems.
- <u>**Provincial**</u>: concerns the residents of a single province, and plays a role in trade and commerce regulation, employment standards, healthcare and education.
- <u>**Municipal**</u>: set up by provinces to oversee the issues that affect cities, towns, and districts. Manages water, sewage, garbage collection, roads/sidewalks, and public transportation. 

### Laws and Regulations

==Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)== was introduced in 2014 to protect consumers from unsolicited online communications. Companies now have to obtain your consent for future messages and be transparent about their identification and contact info, as well as provide an a way to unsubscribe.

The ==Competition Bureau== helps administer and enforce *Acts* to promote fair competition while protecting consumers. The Competition Act, for example, ensures that mergers and acquisitions don’t restrict competition so that consumers can have competitive price and product choices.

==Deregulation== is the removal of some laws and regulation to allow for more competition. 

### Fiscal Policy

==Fiscal policy== is how the government keeps the economy stable through increases and decreases in both taxes and government spending. 

Canada has a low **<u>corporate tax rate</u>**, with a Federal net tax rate of 15%. Once Provincial tax rates are added, the overall tax rates typically between 26-31%. Low corporate tax rates mean corporations have more money to grow the economy and increase productivity by investing back into their business. 

Other than that, businesses usually also have to pay property tax, sales tax, and tariffs on imported goods. When the government collects tax, it gets spent to create more jobs, develop infrastructure, and create new/improved services for Canadians.

Consider the **<u>national debt</u>**, which accumulates interest over time. We want to minimize this so that the government can spend the money on the other initiatives mentioned above. Canada currently has to pay interest on over $660 billion in debt.

## Economic Environment

==Microeconomics== is for individuals and businesses within the economy (supply, demand, scarcity), while ==macroeconomics== takes a broader look and considers GDP, employment levels and interest rates, looking from a governmental standpoint.

### Economic Health

Low economic growth is characterized by high unemployment levels and reduced consumer spending. Businesses must adjust to this, and need to cut costs. This could mean changing production levels or reducing their workforce. 

High economic growth has low unemployment, meaning the consumers have more money to spend. When the GDP is rising from a trough, it’s *recovering*. Once it’s about to hit a *peak*, it is *expanding*. Then once it starts to drop again, it’s in its *contraction* stage. A *recession* can result, and if its effects are prolonged, it can lead to a *depression*.

### Monetary Policy

Canada is recognized worldwide as a stable location to do business. The key priorities for the Bank of Canada include:

- keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable
- managing the complex financial system
- preserving the value of our money and protecting from counterfeit, ensuring confidence in our currency

==Inflation== is the rise in the price of goods and services over time. It can be measured by looking at the ==Consumer Price Index== (CPI), which compares the change in prices for a basket of commonly purchased goods, like food, housing, clothing, transportation and recreation. It can reduce purchasing power of money, and Canada tries to keep it around 2% by adjusting interest rates. 

The Bank of Canada sets a ==benchmark interest rate==, which is the rate at which it loans money to Canada’s major financial institutions. A low rate means that these institutions are encourages to borrow more money, which means more money for businesses to borrow from them. Consumers are encouraged to borrow more when interest rates are low, and save when interest rates rise. 

### GDP

The GDP looks at the total value of final goods and services produces within a country in a year. This means anything created by Canadian and international companies within our borders. It’s a measure of economic and social progress of a country; its growth is desirable. ==GDP per capita== looks at the GDP per person in that country. 

## Social Environment

### Demographic Trends

This takes a look at *age*, *education*, *income levels*, and *diversity* of a population.

#### Age

Baby boomers (born 1946-1965) make up around 30% of the Canadian population, and have lots of money to spend. We also have to consider how they’ll plan to spend money on others, like children and grandchildren. Thus they’re a huge target for a lot of businesses. By staying in tune with demographics, businesses can take advantage of things like this and have more opportunities to grow. 

#### Education

Canada regularly places at the top of the ==Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development== (OECD) study, meaning its got high education and skills compared to other countries. Higher education levels means that a country has high economic growth potential, since educated workforces can be more productive and innovative.

#### Income Levels

Domestically, a country may want to examine its middle class as a potential market, but in a global environment it’s also important to look at the emerging economies where there is a growing middle class with spending power (ie. BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa).

#### Diversity

Employers in Canada understand the value of having a diverse workforce to better serve customers. Diversity means potential to bring in broader skills, perspectives and experiences. Allows businesses to better understand more target markets.

### Changing Social Attitudes

This involves reviewing public opinion, ensuring that attitudes and values of the public on things such as employment conditions and environment be considered. ==Triple bottom line reporting== is a new method for companies to report their impact on financial, social and environmental factors. This reports around people, our planet, and the profits made. 

## Technological Environment

This mainly focuses on the technological resources available to businesses to make progress and grow. Electronics, equipment, telecommunications all contribute to a more connected and fast word. Being able to process data, automate repetitive tasks, manufacturing improvements, etc all contribute to innovation. IoT is growing fast. 

It’s also feared that tech might one day replace the need for any human laborers. To become future-proof, consider how we can embrace change and understand new technologies and processes to stay relevant and be ahead of this change.

### Connecting With Customers 

Benefiting from social media and ads, companies can now interact with customers many different ways simply due to our connected world. By collecting data on customers, they can tailor each individual experience to each unique customer. With such a wealth of data, organizations need to know what to do with it and how it’ll grow their business. Sensitive information means stronger cybersecurity, etc. 

## Porter’s Five Forces

You’ll want to be thinking about the competitors around you (present & future). Organizations should look not only at the domestic competitors, but also internationally due to recent globalization. Online shopping has taken the world by storm, and online retailers can engage customers like never before. 

1. Current Competitors:

   AKA existing rivalry, if you’re entering an industry with entrenched competitors and with many resources, it may be more challenging to get started.

2. Potential Competitors:

   The threat of new entrants, this examines how easy or hard it is for newcomers to join the industry. Some barriers to entry could include **existing dominance**, **capital requirements**, **laws and regulations**, and **economies of scale**. 

3. Substitutes:

   Considering the alternatives available to customers. Companies like Apple have looped their consumers into an ecosystem where they’re almost forced to buy more Apple products to avoid discomfort or lack of compatibility with what they already have.

4. Bargaining Power of Suppliers:

   If you depend on only one supplier, that supplier can potentially raise their prices, knowing that you’ll still have to buy from them. Having bargaining power means that the other party will likely comply with your adjustments in cost and availability. 

5. Bargaining Power of Customers:

   If a buyer has multiple supplier options, they have greater bargaining power and can shop around for the lowest prices/greatest quality. An industry is more attractive to get into if the bargaining power for customers is low. 

### Limitations

It may focus more on the current power relationships which might not be that helpful in industries that are quickly changing. The dominance of a company might also not be accurately depicted. It’s important to use this in conjunction with other tools, like PEST when performing environmental scans. 

## SWOT

SWOT takes both internal and external perspectives when examining a company. Internally, we analyze the **strengths** and **weaknesses** of the organization. This considers both *tangible resources* (ie. human capital, financial and physical assets) and *intangible resources* (ie. knowledge/skills, leadership strength, reputation).

We also analyze external aspects, which are **opportunities** and **threats**. We don’t have control over these factors, but it is important that we know how to respond to them. By performing a PEST or Porter’s Five Forces analysis beforehand, these can easily be identified. Opportunities include changing consumer demand, evolving government policies and adjustment in trade barriers for international markets. Threats could mean recessions, competitor activity, new regulatory requirements or the entry of foreign competitors. 

After conducting a SWOT analysis, there is value in using the results of the assessment to take action and plan your next steps as a company. It’s important to step back and reflect on how to:

- capitalize on your strengths
- improve your areas of weakness
- take advantage of opportunities
- mitigate any threats
