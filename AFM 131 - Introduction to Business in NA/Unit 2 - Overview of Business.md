# Unit 2 - Overview of Business

## Understanding business as a future leader

Being in tune with the business world helps leaders

- understand the changes transforming the industry
- anticipate future developments
- capitalize on new opportunities

Leaders need to be able to articulate stories strategically. This means not only explaining what happened, but interpreting the trends and information to project what the state of business will be in the future. Being able to connect all the individual pieces to paint a coherent and reasonable picture is key.

## Introduction to business

A ==business== is an activity that you intend to carry on for profit.

In the early days, business around Canada was hard because of the **large land mass**, the sparsely spread out population, and the lack of infrastructure to connect the country from coast to coast. It was easier to trade south to the US, rather than nationally. 

Our national trade policy was developed in 1867, placed tariffs on US trading to encourage trade within Canada. Plus the **railway** was built. In Canada, we have a ==mixed economy==, one where some allocation of resources are made by the market, and some are made by the various levels of government that play active roles.

A ==crown corporation== is a company owned by the federal or provincial government. Companies like Canada Post and LCBO are good examples. Recently the govt has been selling these to reduce debt and fund other developments.

## Small Businesses

A ==small business== is defined as an organization that is <u>independently owned and operated</u>, is <u>not dominant in its field</u>, and <u>meets certain standards of size</u> (1-99 employees). Approx 98% of employer businesses are small and about 70% of the workforce works for small businesses.

## Forms of Business Ownership

### Sole Proprietorship

A ==sole proprietorship== is owned and operated by **one person**, and exists once you start selling a product/service. 

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy to set up (just a business registration) | Unlimited liability (no distinction between personal and business assets) |
| Lower start-up costs                          | Business continuity issues (no vacations)                    |
| Freedom and control for owners                | Difficulty raising funds                                     |
| Less regulatory requirements                  |                                                              |

### Partnership

A ==partnership== is a business created with 2+ people (partners) who share ownership. The relationship between partners is defined by a partner agreement, which addresses the nature of business and financial contributions, responsibilities and profit shares from each partner.

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy and inexpensive to form          | Unlimited liability                                  |
| Splitting startup costs               | Potential conflict between partners                  |
| Shared management and decision making | Business continuity (lives and dies by the partners) |
| Less regulatory requirements          |                                                      |

###  Corporation

A business is considered a separate legal entity once it is ==incorporated==. Ownership is through shared capital, and shareholders are not personally liable for debts or acts of the corporation. 

| Advantages                                               | Disadvantages                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Limited liability                                        | Higher start-up costs           |
| Business continuity (ownership is transferrable)         | Greater regulatory requirements |
| Greater access to financing (sell shares, pledge assets) |                                 |
| Tax advantages                                           |                                 |

## Why do Small Businesses Fail?

Generally, businesses that are typically easier to start tend to have the least growth potential and greater fail rates due to larger competition (supply) in the market.

Businesses that are hard to start are more likely to be successful and generate significant profit. Since the difficulty to enter is so high there isn’t much competition, so prices can rise. Typically are businesses where professional training is required (ie. doctor, consulting, etc).

#### Causes of failure:

- lack of small-scale testing
- under/overpricing
- starting with too little capital, or recklessly spending when you have too much
- lack of business/market experience and research
- not considering unforeseen expenses 
- failing to complete accurate records

Common themes include poor management and lack of preparation. To ensure that your business runs smoothly, you should

- Plan your business
- Understand your customers
- Manage your employees
- Maintain accurate records to make informed decisions
- Properly finance your business

## Impact of Globalization on Stakeholders

When conducting business globally, there are many perspectives we must consider:

- **Consumers**: they benefit from worldwide selection and competition
- **Employee**: globalization connects employees with customers and clients from around the world. Could include outsourcing the production or marketing of a company to another country
- **Business Owner**: can increase global presence, go into foreign markets

Competition and advances in connectivity have driven businesses to become more global, virtually not necessarily physically. 

## Why do we Trade?

==Importing== is the purchase of goods and services from another country, while ==exporting== is the sale of such things. The relationship between these two is known as the ==balance of trade==. For a country to prosper over time, it should be selling more than it buys, indicating a *favourable balance of trade (trade surplus)* when exports are greater. The opposite are *unfavourable balances of trades (trade deficits)*.

### The concept of “free trade”

==Free trade== is the trade of goods and services between countries without any political or economic obstruction. Ideally, both countries mutually benefit off of this trade. The issue in the real world is one country will typically have access to more resources than the other, thus giving it more bargaining power.

By selling what you can produce most effectively and buying what you cannot, you’re using your ==comparative advantage==. This works best in a ==free market economy==, where the market determines what goods/services to produce and who gets them without any govt intervention. This is thwarted by trade barriers set by governments to protect domestic businesses.

==NAFTA==, the North American Free Trade Agreement created a free-trade area between Canada, Mexico, and the US. ==CETA== is the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the EU. This entered in September 2017, removing 98% of tariffs.

For Canadian consumers, we got more selection in clothing and food, etc, but for businesses, the European dairy market is larger than the one here. So they struggled. 

## Barriers to Trade

- **Trade protectionism**: limits the import of goods and services through the use of govt regulations
- **Tariffs**: taxes on imports, making imported goods more expensive
- **Import quotas**: limit on the quantity of a product that a country imports
- **Embargo**: a ban on the import or export of specific products, or from a particular country
- **Non-tariff barriers**: restrictive standards on how exactly a product must be sold (ie. font size on nutrition labelling)

## Entering Global Markets: Canada’s perspective

Going international means expanding your customer base and increasing profit potential, but it doesn’t come without risks. 

When exporting, small businesses actually have an advantage in global markets, since they can react faster to changes and wants in the marketplace. Customized attention and tailored adjustments are hallmarks of this. Multinational corporations can market their products where they have a presence. 

When importing, many companies in Canada actually import materials that are used in their businesses to then produce goods and services. Machinery, smartphones, computers, etc. These are monitored by the **Canada Border Services Agency** to keep Canadians safe. 

## Strategies to Enter Global Markets

Strategies that have minimal risk also tend to have the least control and profit potential. On the other end, risky strategies are presented with a greater reward. In order of least to greatest risk, here are some strategies:

- Licensing
  - when a domestic company (==licensor==) allows a foreign company (==licensee==) to make its product in exchange for a fee. 
  - licensors can generate more revenues, and the cost to produce or promote your product in foreign markets are taken on by the licensee
  - could be hard to control since you aren’t directly involved in the business, or the licensee could steal company secrets and become a competitor, and licensing rights could screw you over if your product is suddenly doing better than anticipated but your cut was agreed upon beforehand
- Exporting
  - requires more coordination with respect to shipping, duties, and other regulations, but the market potential is huge and the cost is much lower than establishing a presence in every foreign market
  - it’s tough to identify global customers though
- Franchising
  - selling rights to use the business name and product or service to another party
  - it offers more control than licensing 
- Contract manufacturing (aka outsourcing)
  - finding foreign manufacturer to make your product and then have our own brand name or trademark attached. They don’t have the right to sell your product, just a supplier. You retain ownership of the products.
  - lets you test a new market in a cost-effective way, since you don’t have to invest in a facility there
  - You’ll still need to develop and execute a marketing and promotions strategy to support sales
- International joint ventures and strategic alliances
  - joint ventures are when two or more companies form a partnership to take on a major project
    - benefits include sharing resources and knowledge, as well as access to a market where foreign companies cant operate unless their goods are locally produced
    - drawbacks include becoming too large to function efficiently, and trade secrets being exploited by the other party
  - strategic alliances is similar, but its a long-term partnership to support building competitive market advantages. this typically doesn’t involve sharing costs, risks, management or profits
- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
  - most risky, its when you buy property (or business) and operate in the foreign country. It typically becomes a ==foreign subsidiary==, meaning that it’s a company located in another country owned by you (the parent company). 
  - You have to follow the legal and regulatory requirements of both the parent and foreign subsidiary
  - political unrest could unsettle your operations

## Future Opportunities and Challenges

Canada is moving to expand it’s relationship to other countries like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
