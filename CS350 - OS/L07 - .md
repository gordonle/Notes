## MULTICS

Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. It’s the first OS!

- single level storage (all memory was visible from the file system)
- Dynamic linking - processes can access data, including code, outside of address space, and add them/use/execute this data
- Re-configured hardware while operating (ie removal of CPU, disks, etc)
- Designed for security; “rings” --- master to user



# A1 Hints

Keep track of who’s in the intersection?

kern/test/arraytest.c to use dynamic array, but not needed

doesn’t even check the 3 rules

doesnt even look at destination

doesnt have array or matrix to keep track of cars in the intersection

How do you get the maximum wait time down?

- only need 1 lock
- some # of condition variables
- car is asleep on cv, but then when it wakes up there are already cars in the intersection
- this just loops! how do we avoid this
- do not need a while loop

how do you decide which direction gets to go next

`kern/test/synctest.c`:file_folder: 261, sy3

initialize your stuff!! make sure your owner is set to null, and other stuff

cannot write to memory that you havent allocated
