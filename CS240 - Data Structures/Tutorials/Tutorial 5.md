# Questions to ask during Review

1. Is there a function that exists such that 
   $$
   f(n)\in O(n^2), f(n) \notin \Theta(n^2), f(n)\notin o(n^2)
   $$
   or prove that
   $$
   f(n)\in O(n^2)\land f(n) \notin \Theta(n^2)\implies f(n)\in o(n^2)
   $$
   These two are contradictory. Which one is right?

2. Prove randomized quick-sort expected run-time (best, worst, average)

3. Worst case of `bubble-down` to create a heap

4. Is checking $L = \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$ first principles when deriving run-time
