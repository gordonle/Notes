# Binary and Assembly Basics

## Binary Conversions

> How can we interpret `0101`?

| Unsigned Int | Signed Int | Hexadecimal | Array              |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| 5            | 5          | 0x5         | 4 Booleans/numbers |

> Let’s convert the 8-bit binary number 01101001 into decimal.

| Power of 2 | 2^7^ | 2^6^ | 2^5^ | 2^4^ | 2^3^ | 2^2^ | 2^1^ | 2^0^ |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Binary bit | 0    | 1    | 1    | 0    | 1    | 0    | 0    | 1    |

Summing up the products of each power of 2 with its corresponding binary bit, $1 + 8 + 32 +64=105$.

### Two’s Compliment

> Encode -12 into 8-bit binary

1. Write it out in regular binary

   `0000 1100`

2. Flip the bits

   `1111 0011`

3. Add 1

   `1111 0100`

A shortcut is to read from right to left, and once we encounter a 1 we flip everything *after* it. 

> Encode -123 into 8-bit binary

To encode $-x$, We encode $2^b -x$, where $b$ is the number of bits. So here,
$$
\begin{align} 2^b - x &= 2^8 - 123 \\ &= 256 - 123 \\ &= 133\end{align}
$$
Now encoding 133, we get `1000 0101`

## Assembly Language

In this course we have some special registers:

| $0                                          | $31                             | $3, \$29, \$30                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Contains the value 0 and cannot be modified | Reserved for the return address | Special by convention (holds special data) |

### Constant Values

Load Immediate and Skip is the `lis` command. For example,

```ruby
lis $5
.word 7
```

stores the value 7 into $5.
