## Coordinating Divided Labour

*<u>Coordination</u>* is the process of facilitating timing, communication, and feedback among work tasks.

| Type                              | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Direct Supervison                 | Very tradition, chain of command, managers or supervisors coordinate the work of their subordinates |
| Standardization of Work Processes | For routine jobs, so little supervision is required, so work processes are standardized by rules and regulations |
| Standardization of Outputs        | Concern is shifted to ensuring that the work meets certain criteria/standards. Like budgets |
| Standardization of Skills         | Seen commonly in the case of technicians and professionals. Everyone is trained to a certain degree and has a common understanding of what is expected. |
| Mutual Adjustment                 | Relies on informal communication to coordinate tasks. We adjust based on other’s needs and efforts. |

Ordered from low discretion to high discretion. These are all very basic.

==Integration==: The process of attaining coordination across differentiated departments

==Liaison Role==: Role occupied by a person who is assigned to help achieve coordination between his or her department and another department.

==Task forces==: Temporary groups set up to solve coordination problems across several departments.

==Integrators==: Organizational members permanently assigned to facilitate coordination between departments. 

## Traditional Structural Characteristics

==Span of Control==: The number of subordinates supervised by a manager.

==Flat organization==: An organization with relatively few levels in its hierarchy of authority.

==Tall organization==: An organization with relatively many levels in its hierarchy of authority.

==Formalization==: The extent to which work roles are highly defined by an organization.

==Centralization==: The extent to which decision-making power is localized in a particular part of an organization.

==Complexity==: The extent to which an organization divides labour vertically, horizontally, and geographically.

Typically, *small* organizations are less complex, and *large* companies with many employees exhibit greater complexity.

==Mechanistic Structures==: Org structures characterized by tallness, specialization, centralization and formalization

==Organic Structures==: Org stuctures characterized by flatness, low specialization, low formalization and decentralization.

These two represent *theoretical extremes*, most structures fall between these two.

## Contemporary Organic Structures

Changes in organizational structure can be used as a strategic response.

==Ambidextrous organization==: An org that can simultaneously exploit current competencies and explore emerging opportunities. 

==Network organization==: Liaisons between specialist organizations that rely strongly on market mechanisms for coordination. 

==Virtual organization==: A network of continually evolving independent orgs that share skills, costs, and access to one another’s markets. (ie. Visa, Google)

==Modular organization==: A network org that performs a few core functions and outsources other activities to specialists and suppliers.

### Other Strategies

Most of these involve the relationship *between* organizations.

==Vertical Integration==: The strategy of formally taking control of sources of organizational supply and distribution, sort of like “shock absorbers”

==Mergers==: The joining together of two organizations.

==Acquisition==: The purchase of one organization by another.

==Strategic Alliance==: Actively cooperative relationships between legally separate organizations. 

==Joint venture==: Two or more organizations that form an alliance in the creation of a new organizational entity.

==Establishing legitimacy==: Taking actions that conform to prevailing norms and expectations. 

## Commentary Questions

1. Discuss the implications of mergers and acquisitions for organizational culture.
2. What can organizations do to increase the chances of success in the case of joint ventures, strategic alliances, mergers, and acquisitions?

> **Organizational culture** is defined as the underlying beliefs, assumptions, values and ways of interacting that contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of an organization

Mergers and acquisitions are strategies that enable companies to stay competitive and incite growth. Something that must be accounted for though is the fusion of the two different organizational cultures from both parties. It is important that prior to the merger or acquisition, the two organizations must collaborate and establish a new/revised set of beliefs and values that will define the future of their joint organization. Sharing this with employees beforehand will ease the transition and the organization can continue to maintain it’s productivity and healthy culture. If this does not occur though, the transition could go very roughly. Each organization has their own unique social and psychological environment, one which current employees are accustomed to. If this suddenly shifts, then social and work expectations won’t be as clear to employees, which can cause inner turmoil in the company. This could potentially result in a very unproductive merger/acquisition that, instead of fostering growth, deters the advancement of the organization. It is then the responsibility of managers and supervisors to ensure that everyone is aware of what is occurring, keeping the whole organization up to date and ready to adapt to any potential changes. If done correctly, these could reduce dependency on external resources, or could reduce uncertainty prompted by competition. 

To increase the chances of success in the case of collaborative strategies such as joint ventures, strategic alliances, mergers, and acquisitions, there are a few strategies we can approach them with. Firstly, being able to define the goal and the direction in which they want to work towards is essential in the success of the endeavor. Ensuring that their strategic response (merger, etc) is in fact in alignment with their future goals is vital. Otherwise there will be a conflict of interest in the future, which can lead to turmoil and failure. Next, being able to establish trust amongst each organization. In the event of collaboration between organizations, establishing trust means that each organization is participating not only for their benefit, but for the mutual benefit of the group. This works well when the success of others reflects on more success within your own organization. This also motivates and encourages organizations to maintain transparency and honesty throughout the collaboration.
