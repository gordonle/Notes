## Commentary

> If you were a recent graduate entering a new job, what tactics can be used to increase your power?

It is clear that power relies on one main concept: dependence. The more others depend on you, for whatever reason that may be, the more power you, as an individual, will have. The inverse also applies: the more you depend on others, the less power you will have. As a new graduate entering a new job, it is essential that we make a good first impression, then build on that to grow our power. First and foremost, I need to make sure that I am prepared for the job. Being knowledgeable and developing an expertise on whatever skills and technologies are required for the job is a must. Managers will learn to trust my talent, and peers will respect my decisions and opinions. At the job, being an active and valuable participant in discussions and meetings will also develop my level of expert power and referent power - this is known as rational persuasion. Aside from strictly work-related activities, engaging in social and fun activities with my peers is also a great way to increase my popularity and power. 

Integrating myself as an important and irreplaceable part of the company will grant me the most power. Whether this be through pure technical knowledge (expert and information power), or by being well liked (referent power), peers need to value your ideas and your presence. Gaining the respect of your peers is essential in gaining power in the workplace - the alternative would be to exert legitimate power, which as a new hire I most likely won’t have much of.

As a new employee, I would definitely do my best to integrate myself into the company’s culture and community as fast as possible. This allows me to meet many peers and coworkers, expanding my network of friends and connections. I could then use consultation or inspirational appeals to identify common hobbies and interests. Supporting others’ initiatives is also important, and I can do this through consultation. I believe that people also value leadership and confidence, and rational appeal will allow me to express this. In general, softer tactics will be better received, especially as a new employee. If I've been successful thus far, managers may notice that I am a very positive addition to the company, and they may promote me. My legitimate power will then increase, and the dependency of others on me will grow.
