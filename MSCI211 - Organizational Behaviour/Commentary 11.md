# Chapter 11 - Global: Environment, Strategy, and Structure (Part 1)

==External Environment==: Events and conditions surrounding an organization that influence it’s environment

the external environment of organizations, which had a profound 

2008 financial crisis

organizations are open systems that takes in inputs and returns outputs

external environment

- involved any person, group, event, or condition that lies outside of the static domain of organization
- General Economy:
  - profit from upturns, suffer from downturn
- Customers
  - potential customers to products and services
  - sensitive to customer demands/reactions
- suppliers
  - labor, raw material, equipment
  - shortages can cause severe difficulties
- competitors
  - competes for resources such as customers and supplies
  - successful orgs pay close attention to their competitors activities
- social/political factors
- technologies
  - the ability to adapt
  - good technology allows an org to grow and be effective

Environmental Uncertainty

- When the environment is very complex, difficult to understand and evaluate
- rate of change: static vs dynamic
- a simple static environment provokes the most uncertainty
- increasing uncertainty has predictable effects on organizations

Resource Dependence

- does not mean that orgs are at the mercy of their environments
- orgs need to be able to balance resource dependence and env uncertainty



## Levels of uncertainty

|         | Simple | Complex |
| :-----: | :----: | :-----: |
| Static  |   1    |    2    |
| Dynamic |  2.5   |    4    |

## Organizational Structure

The way in which an organization divides its labor into specific tasks, and achieves coordination between these tasks. 

### Vertical Division of Labour

Allocated authority for planning and decision making. Themes:

- impact on employees autonomy, control, communication
- increased vertical division reduces autonomy, and puts strain on communication
  - autonomy and control
    - a flatter hierarchy spreads out the control around
  - communication
    - the more levels in the hierarchy, the more filtering occurs 

### Horizontal Division

Groups tasks into jobs, then jobs into departments for a company to succeed

Themes:

- Job Design
  - where each 
- Differentiation
  - tendencies for managers in diff places to differ in goals, timespans, and interpersonal styles
- more horizontal division, they get more and more differentiated
- the more this happens, various organizational units tend to operate more autonomously (ie UWaterloo)

## Departmentation

Important aspect of the horizontal division of labour

### Functional Departmentation

Employees with closely related skills and responsibilities are located in the same dep

Advantages:

- efficiency and communication
  - does not duplicate effort, enhances communcation between functions
- performance of functional specialists is easier to evaluate
- better career ladders climb

Disadvantages:

- high degree of differentiation can lead to conflicts between departments 

This works best in small to medium sized firms that offer few product lines or services

### Product Departmentation

Departments are formed under on the basis of particular products or services

Adv:

- better coordination
- can be evaluated as profit centers
- flexibilities, and the ability to respond to customers timely

Disadvantages:

- economies of scale might be threatened 
- professional dev might suffer
- inefficiency may occur as efforts may be duplicated

Better for larger corporations

### Matrix Departmentation

Employees remain members of a functional department while also also reporting to a product/project manager. Attempts to capitalize on the strengths of both Functional and Product Departmentation. 

Disadvantages:

- conflict can arise between managers when they don’t see eye to eye
- employees will have to respond to two managers, and this can lead to miscommunication and stress
- managers thus need to be well trained for this to work

### Others

- Geographical Departmentation
  - departments are created based on geographical locations
  - shortens communication channels, local control
- Customer Departmentation
  - specific customer group
  - the goal is to provide better customer service to each group through specialization
  - same adv and disadv as product departmentation
- Hybrid
  - just a huge mix

## Commentary

> Assume you manage a small R&D department. When making choices concerning structure, would you be more concerned about the external environment, more concerned about technology, or equally concerned about the external environment and technology? Explain your answer.

structure in a small R&D department

- external environment
- technology
- which one should i be more concerned about



Firstly, technology is a component of the external environment, so we’ll approach this problem by viewing “technology” as the method in which we will accomplish our goal, and we’ll view “external environment” as the other components of external environment, such as the general economy, social/political factors, and competitors.

In this specific case, I believe that technology is vital to the success of an R&D department. The very nature of researching and developing new products, services, strategies, techniques, etc revolves around the effectiveness and efficiency of the method in which we are approaching the problem at hand. 

Another vital pillar for R&D is also resources. To be able to perform at a productive level at all times, we will need funding to pay for our employees, to have access to modern technology, to pay for overhead costs, et cetera. We are highly dependent on the resource of money and capital. This can be related to the state of the general economy, as a poor economy can often correlate to less funding, as well as social/political factors, which affect how the general public views our research, which also will influence the amount of funding we receive. 

A final pillar for R&D is the status of our competitors. We need to ensure that we are researching and developing at a competitive rate - otherwise, our competitors will continuously beat us to the next idea and we won’t be very profitable. Timelines must be laid out, and our teams must work towards set deadlines that ensure we have competitive outputs. This pillar is strongly influenced by both the technology we are using and by other components of the external environment.

In conclusion, when considering how to run a small R&D department, I would be equally concerned about technology and the external environment when structuring the department. They both play key roles in being able to successfully run R&D. Aside, the size is smaller, using product departmentation would be most effective. Decreased vertical division of labor would work best, maintaining strong, transparent methods of communication.
