==Groups== become ==Teams== when they meet these conditions:

- members share leadership
- share accountability of work being done
- a *purpose* or *mission* is established
- works on *problem solving* continuously
- measure of *effectiveness* is the team’s outcomes and goals, not individual

## Five Stage Model

1. ==Forming==: characterized by a great deal of uncertainty about purpose, structure, leadership. Complete when members have begun to think of themselves as part of a team.
2. ==Storming==: Intragroup conflict. Members are resisting the constraints that the team imposes on individuality. Complete when a clear hierarchy of leadership is established.
3. ==Norming==: Sense of team identity and camaraderie. Team **norms** are developed, standards for behaviour and work are mutual. Complete when the team structure solidifies and the team has assimilated a common set of expectations about what defines correct behaviour.
4. ==Performing==: Significant task progress is being made. Team energy has transitioned from getting comfortable to completing and reaching the mutual goal.
5. ==Adjourning==: For temporary teams, this is the final stage. The group prepares to split up, and attention is focused on final amenities. Emotions run high, great job everyone.

The **Five-Stage Model** is not a definitive progression. Teams can jump from any stage to any stage, often existing in multiple stages at once. Productivity can arise from any stage, and is dependent on the group members and the environment. This model also ignores organizational context; if rules and tasks are predefined, teams may immediately begin productivity, without developing plans or roles. 

## Punctuated-Equilibrium Model

Temporary groups with deadlines don’t follow the Five-Stage model. Instead, they seem to follow this:

1. First meeting sets group direction
2. First phase is low group productivity and activity (inertia)
3. Transition once the group has used up half its allotted time, major changes are initiated
4. A second phase of inertia follows
5. Group’s last meeting is characterized by high productivity

### Phase 1

We need to recognize that the first meeting sets the team’s direction, where framework of behavioural patterns will emerge. With the direction set, it becomes accepted and will most likely remain throughout the first half of the team’s life. This is inertia. The team is performing at a relatively low state. Tasks are being completed, but it may seem unorganized and cluttered.

### Phase 2

We leave the stage of inertia as timelines and deadlines propel us to complete the work. This phase is characterized by a sharp burst of changes and adaptations, new perspective and approaches take over. This is then followed by a subsequent phase of inertia, before a final push to finish the task at hand for the deadline.

### How can we apply this?

This effectively describes the experiences of student teams created for term projects (lol). At the first meeting, a basic timetable is established and members gauge each other. The project requirements are discussed and debated, then the team will regularly meet up until around the halfway mark, when all the problems arise. Discussion opens, criticism is taken more seriously, and necessary changes are made. The team is propelled towards a new (hopefully better) direction, until the final meeting where the remaining issues are resolved. 

This model characterizes deadline-oriented teams as exhibiting long periods of inertia, with brief revolutionary changes that incite productivity, sparked by the awareness of time and deadlines.

## Effective Teams

There are four general categories that are required:

1. Resources and other contextual influences
   - Support from the organization itself (ie technology, staffing, etc)
   - Establishing leadership and structure to define goals and direction, mentorship, trust and belief in one another
   - Performance evaluation and rewards (wages, incentives, group-based appraisals, profit sharing, gainsharing, etc)
2. Team composition
   - Skills needed are technical expertise, problem-solving/decision making, interpersonal skills for conflict resolution, feedback, etc
   - Personality influences team behaviour, so we must ensure that members are cohesive and can work together
   - Roles must be filled (**task-oriented**, **maintenance**, etc). Individual roles often take away from team goals, so role expectations need to be set.
   - Group diversity is the presence of a heterogenous mix of individuals. This sparks more creative ideas and collaboration.
3. Work design
   - autonomy and the ability to challenge yourself to use multiple skills boost motivation and increase team effectiveness.
   - An increase of members’ sense of responsibility for and ownership of the work make the work more interesting to perform.
4. Team process
   - Specific, measurable and common goal/purpose, and high reflexivity.
   - Confidence that they will succeed is team efficacy. Established mental models, accountability of all members.
   - Managing the level of conflict is essential. Conflict isn’t bad, and can actually lead to higher productivity, but they cannot overshadow the goal of the team.

Potential group effectiveness + Process Gains - Process Losses = Actual group effectiveness.

Ineffective characteristics:

- refusing to share issues and concerns
- depending too much on the leader
- fail to follow through on decisions
- hiding conflict and causing tension
- failing at conflict resolution
- forming cliques and subgroups
- acting mainly in self interest rather than for the group

## Virtual Teams

Teams that use computer technology as their main form of communication and interaction. Members can be remotely located from anywhere in the world.

## Final Notes

Note that teams are not always the way to go! Often certain tasks are better performed by individuals. If a clear, mutual goal cannot be established, members don’t rely on each other, or clear roles be defined/allocated, this may be a sign that a team may not be the ideal way to tackle the problem.

# Commentary 5 Questions:

> **<u>Question 1:</u>** How could you use the punctuated-equilibrium model to better understand team behaviour?

The punctuated-equilibrium model helps us understand how deadline-oriented teams behave throughout their lifetime, from conception to adjourning. When working in a team, I often felt the need to start early and finish before the deadline, to handle any unexpected hiccups. I realize now that this depends on the schedules, the motivation, and the participation of all team members. Always being productive is not possible, and actually may work against productivity.

Initially, interactions may feel strained, as members aren’t fully comfortable yet. This is normal, and fades once the team begins discussing the project itself. The direction is then set. I’ve seen that, even after the first meeting, members aren’t sure of their responsibilities and how the team will proceed. I also think that this could be caused by a lack of communication amongst team members - members aren’t comfortable confronting one another about problems and questions they may have, so progress is slow.

Team behaviour seems to be highly dependent on the motivations of the members. They are inspired by the stress of a deadline, which sparks productivity. Conflict is good, and can resolve problems we didn’t even know we had.

> **<u>Question 2:</u>** Think about a team in which you have participated and describe any ineffective characteristics that the team displayed. How this impacted the effectiveness of the team?

In first year, I took ENGL119 to further my technical writing skills. Our cumulative project was done in a group of four, and we were to pitch a startup idea to the class, including a business plan, prototype and much more. We were able to pick our own teams, so my friend and I decided to pair with another group. After our first meeting, it was established that I would be the CEO of the team - or the “leader”.

I soon noticed that the other two members of the group were very shy and did not open up easily. They were not communicating with the rest of the team, acted in their own self interest, discussed only between themselves, and generally maintained their subgroup within our team. This caused many issues: there was confusion about roles, and issues were not being shared and discussed. This stunted our productivity severely - it felt as if we didn’t have a mutual direction or goal. Furthermore, I felt as leader, the members relied on me heavily to delegate tasks and to tell them exactly what to do. This also hindered the pace at which work was being completed. Due to these negative characteristics displayed by my team, our team lacked much productivity.
